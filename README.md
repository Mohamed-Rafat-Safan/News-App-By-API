# News-App-By-API


This tabik displays popular news in the world by abbreviating the country.

Send the abbreviation of the country to the API and it will bring all the news available.

You can also save important or favorite news in saved fragment.

You can also search for a specific news and it will bring all the news similar to this search.

I also used room db to store all the news that was watched, and he can delete it and return it again by pressing undo.
